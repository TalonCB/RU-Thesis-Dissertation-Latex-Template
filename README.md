## Known Issues

- [#2](/issues/2), it is found that when using a local editor like TeXLive 2020 + VS Code + Latex Workshop, you might not be able to generate the List of Abbreviations page (Page vii). It will be blank except the page number "vii". This could be caused by different implementations of Latex. Some users may also meet this problem if their template files (*.tex/*.bib/*.cls, etc.) are in a subfolder. To solve this problem, please move all the template files to the root folder.
